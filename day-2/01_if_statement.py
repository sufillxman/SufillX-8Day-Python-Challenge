# Certainly! Here’s a beginner-friendly explanation of the if statement in Python, with examples and a memory trick.

# What is an if statement?
# An if statement lets your program make decisions. It checks if a condition is True or False. If it’s True, the code inside the if block runs. If not, it skips that block.

# Basic Syntax
# Example 1: Checking Age
# Explanation:

# if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True

# age= 18

# if age >= 18:
#     print("You are an adult.")    

# The program checks if age is greater than or equal to 18.
# If yes, it prints "You are an adult."
# Example 2: Using else
# Example 3: Using elif
# Memory Trick
# Think of if as a gatekeeper:

# age = 15

# if age >= 18:
#     print("You are an adult.")
# else:
#     print("You are not an adult.")

# If the condition is True, the gate opens and lets the code inside run.
# If not, the gate stays closed.
# Hindi Analogy:
# "अगर (if) बारिश हो रही है, तो छाता ले लो।"
# (If it is raining, then take an umbrella.)

# Tips for Remembering
# Always use a colon : after the condition.
# Indent the code inside the if block (usually 4 spaces).
# You can use elif (else if) and else for more choices.

# marks = 75

# if marks >= 90:
#     print("Grade: A")
# elif marks >= 60:
#     print("Grade: B")
# else:
#     print("Grade: C")
